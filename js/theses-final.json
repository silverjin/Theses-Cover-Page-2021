    "Abstract": "Humans are composed of thousands of arteries that distribute supplies and\ninformation to every single cell. These uncountable processes take place in\nevery being that habitats this world. It makes it even more surprising that\nthe structures humanity created seem so similar to its bodies. In some\naspects, it could not be in more excellent contrast to the natural system. 1\nAll of these mechanisms are fascinating and happen on many levels. As the\nmost elaborate examples of Infrastructure, cities illustrate the complexity of\ndependencies in the best way. That is probably why city-builders video\ngames are my favourite kind. To win, one tries optimizing profit and\ndevelopment of their settlement. The always apparent struggle between\nearning and achieving personal goals never leaves the player.\nFlourishing in the game means keeping the attractiveness of the city high.\nIncreasing the level of security and finding employment are some of the\nmain factors in achieving that. As one builds and tries to keep everybody\nhappy, realizes one thing - it becomes visible where the poorer or less\neducated population lives. It does not make sense to invest there. One\nmaintains the status quo - no profit means losing - and struggling with\nmeeting the wealthy citizens' needs is already hard.\nUnfortunately, playing on and taking the role of God's hand, one observes\nthat people's reality is becoming grimmer and grimmer. They are just\nanother number when deciding where to put the next school or a bus stop.\nSomebody has to be left out; it is impossible to make everybody happy. The\nsad actuality is that in the game where one can stop time and carefully\nconsider the best solution, most players imitate the cold decision-making\nprocess known to us from the real world.",

    "Thesis Title": "Ritualistic sacralization of self as means to communicate with anima telluris",
    "Abstract": "        Early in The Ethics Spinoza argues that there is only one substance, which is absolutely infinite, self-caused, and eternal. He calls this substance “God”, or “Nature” \n        —Deus sive Natura. \n        The Bible mentions that God reveals himself in nature. To see His creation is to see a piece of Him. As it says in Romans 1:20, “For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.” \n\nSo why do we make such an effort to exclude nature from our lives, in the concrete boxes we call homes, the plastic wrapped goods we call food ? Where did human intervention stop having a sense of the presence of Spinoza’s “substance”, while all that remains is the newtonian tangibility in the materiality of our constructed spaces? What materials can we construct our spaces of? Is there a ritualistic attention we can provide to a space? We are seeing more and more how the alteration of food, for instance, is making us sick - isolated nutrition pills, genetically modified vegetables, added hormones - the list goes on about human interventions on original manifestations. \n\nI would like to explore on a spiritual level the effects of nature and space on my being. I will undergo a series of ritualistic interventions, in search of a new path, the line between the yin and yang, to explore the space within myself and manifest outside of myself, using the elements of nature to rid myself of layers of societal comfort to find a new truth.",

    "Abstract": "I researched stairs, not as an object, but as a narrative seed of potential. My motivation was a simple curiosity about what stories can be constructed from an object deemed mundane, at least by me. Stairs was an intuitive choice, maybe random, but randomness is an asset considering what I set out to do. \nI started the research by broadening the chosen term as much as I could and then following as many associative paths as I could. All readings, curious facts, news articles I came across in the months of August to December were poured into the soup of other stories searching for links and narratives. Once an association was made, more reading and listening, and associations in that direction followed. As a result, there are many loose or thin threads left in the drafts. But, two sturdy, concluded, even interesting threads were woven. However, all the string pieces, the fluff balls, the stories that could have happened are just as relevant to describe stairs and only serve to further prove that an object cannot be fully contained no matter how big the box is.\n",

    "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence is becoming increasingly integrated into global society – it is often referred to as the latest general-purpose technology . Significant advances in machine learning and proliferation of big data have resulted in a social climate sensitised towards AI’s exponential societal integration. Upon closer examination, an observable gap becomes clear between AI’s status quo of rapid social integration, and the hype in its mediated visuality.\nI argue that this gap – between the actual social implementation and integration of AI, and the sublime, religiously exalted, mediated visual image of it – consists of a fundamental misrepresentation and non-understanding of AI, intensification of technicist power and globalising capital accumulation.\n",

So much has changed. Back in the old days we used to care for the little things, battling four times a year equipped with bundles of fennel we fought against dark witches attempting to protect the earth and to guarantee its fertility. Remember boy, fertile is the soil as well as our relationship with it. But we were not bound to last, young man. \nThere has always been someone bigger than us, running on the path of power, promising a shiny destination to whoever followed.” \n        “And in the end, did you follow too?” \n“My people always chose to stay, not to follow any other path. \nRemember young man, sometimes when you chase something you don’t know how it looks like, it is hard to know when you will find it... No, we did not follow. Instead we’ve been relegated to the Archives, repressed within our own skins. We have been sent to the afterlife, for an unknown reason, at least unknown to us.” \n        “But if you’re dead, how come you are still here?” \n“There are values that last longer than laws, symbols that took roots, rituals that are intrinsic in the human body, connections that are worth more than gold. Have you ever asked yourself why cults never really die?” \n        “Why did you not die?” \n“Patterns evolve throughout time and space; if the human nature is dualistic, its drive must be too. While someone strives for fame, power or wealth, someone else is looking for awareness, knowledge and balance. Certain kinds of rituals, traditions and beliefs are always recurring… How do the essence of spiritual tribes, cults and cultures that have been erased by great powers, survive throughout time?”",

It has been more than 2 years now since I have noticed that something was different inside me. I could not function properly in many ways and I was afraid because I was unfamiliar with my new-self. Everyday was a burden living in the shadows and I thought it might be even better if I could just disappear. I realized I should get consulted and now I know I am going through a mental disorder. Even though it sounds a bit depressing but that is not the only side of it. Because of the illness I was able to think more. Sometimes it acts as a disrupter but at times it becomes a pilot. In my thesis, I want to explore the correlation between depression(or in a broader sense: mental illness) and creativity with references of studies; some arguments of philosophers in history, and three interviews I had with my friends who had experienced melancholia. By writing this thesis, I want to understand more about myself and make people with/without mental disorder see the positive sides of it and change the perception of depression that we commonly have.",

In this thesis,\nI classified the way women are consumed in horror movies into four categories. Each chapter will provide dirsect examples through specific films for each type, and I will observe the comparison the way female characters are portrayed in past horror films versus the way female characters are portrayed in modern horror films. I will analyze the gaze we look at horror movies and create an opportunity to think about new directions for horror movies to move forward.

    "Thesis Title": "The Concept of Fear",
    "Abstract": "This thesis is about the concept of fear and how this emotion shapes and influences us and our society. Very few people understand the powerful emotion of fear and why it distorts our perceptions. Fear manifests itself in many different ways. It accompanies humans in everyday life. \n\tIt can be as small as a bee. It can be as big as an elephant. It can be as complex as existential anxiety in a human. Fear is a deeply wired reaction evolved over the history of biology, protecting organisms against perceived threat to their integrity or existence. It is personal, powerful and a raw emotion. It can make your whole body stop from working or it can be the fuel that drives you. Fear leads us more often than not into irrationality, unpredictable behaviour and madness. \n\tThe emotion of fear has a commanding moral position within the society of the 21st century. Today, larger systems of fear, such as politics, religion and the media are feeding human society and influence us in a detrimental way. Fear can be misused in all these systems of power in order to control, manipulate and divide society, which benefits the ones in positions of power.\n\nFear is real and illusion at the same time.\n",

    "Abstract": "When the doorbell isn't ringing we don't go up to the door and open it, but why do we keep unlocking our phone when there is no new message? During the day we keep repeating this action. What are we exactly trying to fulfill by repeating this action on a daily basis?\nThe past two years my smartphone and I have gone through countless amounts of text and phone calls, but now the time has come to say goodbye. Seemingly, one of the closest relationships that we can have is not with other humans but with our smartphones. People all of a sudden depend so much on a little piece of technology to the extent that they are willing to purchase a new device with relatively few improvements. We all crave the perfect relationship, one that will last us forever, but we should ask ourselves the following: Is that realistic? Now with the countless dating apps around us that offer us new people to meet, every single day we tend to think whether there is someone better out there to be in a relationship with. Is it true that the grass is always greener on the other side and does this also apply to our smartphones? And lastly, how perfect is this relationship with our smartphone in comparison to the relationships we have with other people?\nIn my research, I am looking into the elements that make us have a toxic relationship with our phones, and with the help of a timeline created around the two-year relationship you would have with a new phone. My research starts with explaining one specific type of user. I will furthermore take you to a place where phones are worshipped, a place where one’s candles were lit on iPad's, so to speak. And finally, I’ll explain how one keynote presentation changed everything in the world of smartphones.",

    "Thesis Title": "Tie your hair up, Point your stick, Make some magic",
    "Abstract": "In 1960s Japan, an animation genre emerged which for the first time targeted young female viewers: that of the 'magical girl'. With a simple storyline depicting ordinary girls transforming into powerful, magical beings, this animation genre became the representative offspring of Shojo culture. \n\nAs a young girl, I used to sit in front of the television everyday at 5pm. To cheerful music, girls with bright smiles would appear on that screen. Girls who were optimistic. Who cried for their friends, would find true love and who eventually would save their world. The magical girl delivered the hopeful message to young girls like me that “girls can do it!”. In a patriarchal society which women could not be at the centre of, the magical girl became a signal of hope for womanhood in the future. \nThe girl who badly wished to become such a magical girl grew up to be a 25 year-old woman. Did she realise her dream at last? Or did she grow to question it?\n\nThis thesis commences with a question about girl-power and whether or not the magical girl is capable of realising it. In this thesis I have set up the discussion on the magical girl through using the format of email, in which the reader takes up the role of respondent. In these emails, I would ask who the magical girl is; how the concept of the magical girl came to be; how the magical girl affects girlhood; what kind of social norms and values this magical girl institutes into the younger generation, and what kind of idealised female figure is created and sustained by the popularity of the magical girl genre.\nIn this thesis, I would like to unveil a little corner of the hidden items of male gaze and misogyny in popular entertainment. Furthermore, I (as a woman who was constantly taught how to behave, act, and think along the long-established lines of seemingly unchangeable, societal norms) would like to suggest what direction we could take in order to provide a new, more ambitious generation of magical girls to the women of tomorrow.",

    "Abstract": "Mickey Mouse, one of the most known pop icons of the recent centuries, is usually referred to as a symbol of innocence, joyfulness. A character so disseminated within our modern culture that we hardly even question it’s origin or even message, at this point. In this thesis I investigate how the portrayal of Mickey Mouse has shifted throughout history, and how there have always been intentions behind these metamorphosis. From starting out as mere entertainment purpose, to representing the US army as a propaganda boy, to being an ideological tool in the spread of the capitalist ideal, how is it that Disney have maintained the image of the innocent Mickey throughout the decades? Such is the power of the icon in maintaining myths.\n\n\nStarting off from looking into how my personal relation with such an icon originated, going into a historical analysis into the evolution Mickey under the guide of Walt Disney, into breaking apart the inner workings of the iconography itself, this text is an attempt to understand the relations between the parts that compose the icon of Mickey Mouse. It encompasses theories of mass communication, linguistic and pictorial patterns we recognize and relate to, as well as the societal relations that surge from a character having a near god-like omnipresence across the globe.\n\n\nThis is not only a statement on the dualities an, at first inoffensive, icon can have, but also a speculation on the origins and consequences of the state of society and it’s relation to icons in a capitalist mindset.\n\n\n\"I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing—that it was all started by a mouse.\"\n\n\n—Walt Disney",

We are dealing with a shifting baseline syndrome, where the essence of death has almost been forgotten. In day to day life, humans are no longer confronted with death in a natural way. There has been a visualization of death in western society that is rooted in fear. There needs to be a systematic shift from disconnect to symbioses that will turn fear into harmony. We need to change the cultural hero system in which human significance is rooted in being alive, and separated from the essence of life itself. Embracing, and re-visualising death as something natural and beautiful could diminish fear, anxiety and most of all reshape our way of living to a more positive, curious and free one.

    "Abstract": "This thesis is about the nostalgia in Chinese pop music in the last thirty years of 20th century. It investigates the nostalgia embedded in the music: what is the nostalgia addressed by the songs? What did people feel nostalgic about and how did it come in shape in relation to the society and culture?\n\nFrom the emerging folk music in Taiwan in 70s and 80s, to the classic rock in Hong Kong’s “golden age”, and to the heavy metal from Beijing’s music scene in early 90s, the thesis examines the nostalgia in the music, songwriting and its consumption—through a lens of “light-weighted” media, a folk document, and an important art form: pop music.\n\nNostalgia is about longing, especially for an unvisited place. It mourns for a displacement in time and space, and yearns for either a realistic or a mythical return. It is also about belonging to a place or a community. One type of it is about belonging to a nation, one’s homeland. \n\nChinese language and culture shape the nostalgia in the music. In contrast to the west, nostalgia in Chinese pop music is expressed differently, with a language that is more impersonal and general. How people conceive time influences on how people feel nostalgic. Some nostalgia narratives in the music show that the Chinese conception of time is a non-linear one.\n\nRestorative nostalgia attempts to restore the lost home, the origin and the tradition. Reflective nostalgia focuses on the longing itself and delays the homecoming. These two types of nostalgia can co-exist and intertwine in one song.\n\nMusic as an art form grows into the space, the performance, the aesthetics and social interaction—Karaoke can be a place for people to indulge in nostalgia.\n",

With not changing the narrative of the object, the disbalance between the\nWestern Society and the countries that were their former colonies will never change.\nI wanted to find out how the human centered approach influenced the narrative of a looted\ncultural heritage object, with in this case specific focus on the bust of Nefertiti .\nThere are different parties involved, so by understanding them, I could figure out how the\nissue is structured. After writing my thesis, I can conclude that I still share the same values\nas the countries that are fighting for their right to have access to their cultural heritage object.\nIn my thesis, I found out that the solution for approaching the issue around looted cultural\nheritage objects is communication. With this we can collectively start creating a new\nnarrative around these object.",

    "Thesis Title": "Looking at #femvertising* through the eyes of feminists",
    "Abstract": "In this thesis I am researching the concept of #femvertising. According to the advertising industry, femvertising is a form of advertising that employs pro-female talent, messages, and imagery to empower women and girls. With this type of advertising, I have been confronted with since I was a 12-year-old girl who was learning from media, like tv and the internet, what it means to be a woman. Where I was first mesmerized by this femvertising, I started to grow an annoyance and anger towards femvertisments. However, I didn’t completely understand why. Learning from writers like Sara Ahmed, Simone de Beauvoir, Guy Debord, Betty Friedan, Roxane Gay, Jean Kilbourne, Naomi Klein, Katie Martell, Caroline Criado Perez and Andi Zeisler. But also, by looking at different types of femvertisments over the years and looking at designers harnessing political topics like feminism in their works. I concluded that most companies, that are aligning themselves with feminism through advertising, aren’t practising what they preach. They are merely using feminism this to appeal more to a demographic of female consumers. Which leads towards stylistic, aesthetic and empty representations of feminism known as: Marketplace feminism. The biggest danger of Marketplace feminism is that people might subconsciously start to think that things have already improved, and we no longer need feminism. However, numbers are show there is still a very long way to go. By redefining Femvertising, I want to put more emphasis on the fact the goal of advertising is always to sell a product. Femvertising is a form of advertising that is taking advantage of feminist imagery and ideas, to sell products and change consumers’ brand perspective. \nUnexpectedly, through researching this topic I understand better what feminism means to me and how as a graphic designer I want to apply it in my work.",

    "Abstract": "As long as I can remember, I have played video games my whole life. What attracted me the most to video games, is their visual side. Stunned by the graphics and their detailed storylines I kept playing, while also being blinded by the fantasy realms that opened up before me in which I could emerge myself in for countless hours. Never did I think about how gaming could improve or decrease the quality of my life. For my thesis I therefore asked myself the following question: what kind of problems and solutions reside in the medium of video games? \n\nIn each chapter I will guide you through both positive and negative aspects which I found are present in the medium of video games. These aspects are visual, technical, social, psychological, political and culture. The discussion of these different aspects will be accompanied with personal stories from my past in relation to gaming. With these findings I will show how much videogames are grounded in reality, therefore being able to generate both problems and solutions for the user.\n\nIn Playing with Realities I aim to show the great potential video games have to offer, while also spreading awareness of problems which lie in the medium. Video games have so much to offer when being used in a healthy and responsible manner.\n",

    "Abstract": "This thesis explores the production, erasure, and retrieval of cultural heritage, in the context of the Danish colonization of Greenland. Throughout history, mechanisms of worship and negation have been used to marginalize and demonize, thus Christianity played a crucial role in the invasion of Greenland and the subsequent exploitation of the land and its people. I approach the tradition of Inuit storytelling, knowledge-production and spirituality to decenter euro- and anthropocentric perspectives which up until now have functioned to prevent Greenlandic sovereignty and survival. I propose the mermaid as a tool for critically engaging with the dominant narratives and giving voice to decolonial resistance.",

We can find these afterimages in some of the most popular\ncontemporary books, movies and TV shows. Is this phenomenon a reaction\nto a world where everything is known through science, and there’s little\nuse for magic?\n By employing the empirical method, I come in physical contact with remains\nof history, try to understand the purpose of these visual afterimages.

    "Thesis Title": "Beauty of Not Being Found",
    "Abstract": "As the internet is more and more surveilled and centralized, its ‘dark’ counterpart, The Dark Web, has become more relevant as a place to connect. Meanwhile, anonymity is often considered as something suspicious. The Dark Web sparks my curiosity. It seals and holds something mystical around itself. Is this because it is harder to access than the 'normal' internet, or maybe because the anonymity of the Dark Web is convenient for criminal activities and I might find myself in a space that is dangerous?\n\nThis thesis intends to find out what the potentials are for an anonymous space such as the Dark Web. Why is there a 'dark' version of the web? I wish to explore the Dark Web. First, I wish to contextualize the Dark Web, what is the system behind it, and how does it work. Therefore, I need to go on field research and experience the Dark Web for myself. Additionally, I will end this thesis with a part in which artists have responded on surveillance, being monitored, digital footprints, missing and creating anonymity that form the context of the Dark Web.",

    "Abstract": "Inspired by my work as a hostess in a nursing home along with the text I read for one of my philosophy classes: Nostalgia and Its Discontents by Svetlana Boym, I decided to base my thesis on the topic of nostalgia. Longing for a home that no longer exists or has never existed. Nostalgia is a sentiment of loss and displacement, but it is also a romance with one’s own fantasy. The danger of nostalgia is that it tends to confuse the actual home and the imaginary one. In my thesis I am exploring multiple answers to the question: how did nostalgia’s meaning develop from the coined moment of the terminology, and how has this concept been experienced in Europe since the 2000’s (with special focus on the period from 2010-2020) in comparison to the 17th century? By combining personal memoir/experiences and philosophical/historical analysis, I tried to find answers to this question. Nostalgia underwent some particularly significant metamorphosis’s. From a curable disease to an incurable feeling of longing.",

    "Abstract": "North African oral history and traditions are being and have been erased. Most/Nearly all (written) accounts of these practices are from an outsider perspective whether it is from the Antiquity with Herodotus and Virgil, the Arabic sources during The Middle Ages, or the later colonial reports, mostly focusing on Morocco or Kabylia country drawing generalities from it. This thesis aims to investigate and test how magical realism in North African oral tradition could be a tool for learning, or a tool to understand and challenge existing power relationships through storytelling.\n\nTo know how these modes of storytelling can function and what their societal uses are and how they changed, shifted, or adapted in a contemporary context, I will look at how these oral traditions have influenced and adapted through decolonial tools of resistance as well as in popular culture, as well as in stories told to me by my parents.\nConsidering the region's history of invasions, those practices were built to resist even though those knowledges and practices are disappearing in their traditional form due to the colonial industrialisation/”modernity”.\n\nThe agency of magic in this storytelling is to provoke a sense of power and awe and empower the themes of the story. This way of telling stories shifted and adapted in contemporary popular culture, to re-interpret the past, to engage people, to reflect and to act in a decolonial manner. It is also sometimes used and instrumentalised to fit the dominant narrative.",

    "Thesis Title": "Denkbeelden van de virtuele zandbak",
    "Abstract": "Minecraft is de best verkochte game aller tijden. Voor veel van de, voornamelijk jonge, gebruikers is Minecraft een dagelijkse (virtuele) realiteit, waardoor de game een zekere invloed heeft. Het is daarom van belang dat het massamedium verantwoordelijk om gaat met deze invloed. Maar aangezien de game geen duidelijk doel heeft is het niet helder welke boodschap Minecraft zijn gebruikers meegeeft en of deze wel verantwoordelijk is. Een methode om deze boodschap te achterhalen is door te onderzoeken welke denkbeelden er worden gestimuleerd. Daarom luidt mijn onderzoeksvraag als volgt: Welke denkbeelden over de fysieke wereld en haar bewoners worden er gestimuleerd in de virtuele wereld van Minecraft?\n\nUit het onderzoek blijkt dat Minecraft veel overeenkomsten heeft met neoliberale en koloniale denkbeelden. Zo stimuleert de game bijvoorbeeld spelers om de wereld te behandelen als onuitputbare bron en maakt hen superieur aan de andere bewoners van de virtuele wereld. Er kan dan ook gesteld worden dat het niet verantwoordelijk is om toekomstige generaties deze denkbeelden mee te geven. Het zou verstandiger zijn als Minecraft de game mechanics aanpast waardoor er een wereld ontstaat zonder scheve machtsverhoudingen en die reageert op de handelingen van de speler. Door te breken met de onverantwoordelijke denkbeelden ontstaat er een virtuele wereld die er voor zou kunnen zorgen dat toekomstige generaties hun eigen wereldbeeld en maatschappij bevragen.",

    "Abstract": "The development of war and the war industry in the 20th century with its reflection in modern art. \n        This thesis aims to explore the ways in which modern artists reflect war and how it compares to the self promoted image presented by the hidden defence industry.\n        My research will be conducted through interviews with different artists who visited weapons trade fairs and with artists who documented wars from their own experiences on the front lines. In further steps the work of artists will be analyzed from the past who were soldiers themselves or who painted post war paintings as well as anti-war paintings.\n        The defence industry in itself is a hidden world which wants to keep their real face as secretive as possible from the public eye. The industry creates a fantasy world of clean aseptic war where you can comfortably destroy your target from the other side of the world. Instruments and tools developed and produced for killing should not be a hidden matter, neither should they be marketing themselves as a helping hand with a calm conscience. The slaughtering and displacement of human life has always been a tragedy and never a solution. Still, stock prices of defence companies continue to grow with each passing year and their sales continue to skyrocket because countries all around the world keep investing due to their exponentially increasing defence budgets.\n        As Erich Maria Remarque formulated in his book;\nAll Quiet on the Western Front:\n\n“I always thought everyone would be against the war until I found out that there are those who are for it, especially those who don’t have to go in..”",

To bacterias and fungi that can digest pet plastics and toxis polluters… Animal species which have developed bio-morphism due to different factors influencing their environments.
